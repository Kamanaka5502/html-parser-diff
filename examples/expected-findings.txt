Expected divergences between raw HTML and DOM:

1. Parser inserts: <html>, <head>, <body>, <tbody>
2. Missing </td> and </tr> are auto-closed
3. <p> and <div> are reparented and closed
4. <span> is auto-closed
5. Text inside <script> that looks like HTML is NOT parsed as DOM nodes
6. DOM tree contains nodes never present in raw source
7. Several raw structural signals map to fewer DOM nodes
